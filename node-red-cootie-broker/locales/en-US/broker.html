    <p>Provides a connection to a remote CootiePy broker connected by a (USB) serial port, http URL, or another 
        Cootie node. CootiePy broker uses request/response protocol for a node-red client (i.e Cootie node) to 
        Cootie broker (i.e. QTPy based) server. This allows a <b><i>cootie broker</i></b> node to 
        function as a remote asynchronous sensor or interface or as a command node for the CootiePy broker.</p> 
        
        
    <p> The <b><i>broker-connection-config</i></b> node defines the connection parameters of the serial port(s), http, 
        and cootie client/server connections for the broker nodes. Multiple broker nodes may be assigned to a single 
        connection and mupltiple ports may defined as well to serve multiple CootiePy brokers in different locations.
        Connection configuration includes an optional debug flag to enable verbose debug messages to the runtime log
        for tracing message handling between the broker node and the remote CootiePy broker.</p>

    <p> Per the defined (CootiePy) broker protocol, the broker node formats a <code>msg.payload</code> as newline 
        terminated JSON and writes it to the connection, normally a serial port. It establishes a node specific event 
        listener on the respective connection object for selectively capturing appropriate return messages. The 
        connection handler parses incoming data line-by-line with each line treated as a JSON object. It translates the 
        JSON into a JavaScript object, and extracts the appropriate field(s) as needed to determine where to route the 
        output, then passes the response to the appropriate node.</p> 

    <p> By default, the protocol uses a tag property to identify and route the node specific messages. Payloads including
        a <code>msg.payload.tag</code> create route aliases to the node's defined event allowing the routing to be 
        dynamically controlled. Action messages, i.e. {id:...}, without a tag add an alias for the <b><i>id</i></b> 
        property value. Similarly, command messages without a tag, i.e. {cmd:...}, route to the event alias of the value
        'cmd', regardless of their origin. This allows a single broker node to capture all command messages for dianostics.
        Events route to a special <b></i>*<i></b> wildcard listener if no other listener match occurs, or if the payload 
        includes a 'cmd', 'err', or 'ack' field. This enables single point capture of <i>untagged</i> messages as well as 
        all system generated messages intended for debug to a single point by defining that node's tag='*'. Therefore, a 
        single message sent by a broker may result in multiple returns to different nodes. Per the protocol, a single
        message may also result in multiple responses to the same node. For example, an input may be configured to 
        automatically update its state once a minute with just a single request command.</p>
        
    <p> Return messages for the same node may not return in order. For example, a OneWire temperature reading may take
        1 second to complete, whereas an I2C endpoint messge sent next may return immediately before the OneWire endpoint
        has finished. Events also occur asynchronously between broker nodes. Per the protocol, a single request message 
        may also result in multiple responses to the same node, if for example, an I/O sensor is configured to return a 
        reading once a minute after an initial command. Additionally, setting the tag property for a node may result in 
        receiving messages without having ever sent a message, for example, setting the tag to <b>cmd</b> will capture 
        all the returned command messages even if they originated from another node.</p>
        
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Name</code> defines the display name for the node.</li>
        <li><code>Connection</code> defines the connection configuration of the node. Required.</li>
        <li><code>Color</code> defines an optional color of the rendered node.</li>
        <li><code>Mode</code> defines the type of configuration for the node and selects the appropriate configuration
            properties.</li>
        <li><code>Tag</code> defines a unique node identifier (sent with the payload) that represents the return
            message routing event.</li>
        <li><code>ID</code> is the id field sent <b>AS</b> the payload if the received <code>message.payload</code>
            is not an object.</li>
        <li><code>Acknowledge</code> an optional flag to specify if node messages should be acknowledged. Values include
            None: No acknowledgement, Ack: Acknowledgement message, Log: Print acknowledgement on remote end, Echo: Echo 
            the full message back to the node.</li>
        <li><code>Topic</code> defines the default output topic for node messages. The topic of the last received
            message overrides this value.</li>
        <li><code>Output</code> defines a template string (w/o backticks) used to filter output messages from responses.</li>
        <li><code>Status</code> defines a template string (w/o backticks) used to filter status text from responses.</li>

        <li><code>Custom</code> is a JSON definition OR a JSONata expression that defines the request payload.</li>
        <li><code>Field</code> defines a key for merging a scalar payload into a custom payload. For 
            example, an incoming timestamp payload could be assigned to a time field to timestamp the request payload
            without any code involved.</li>
    </ul>
    Notes: 
    <ol><li><b>Note: <code>msg.payload</code> <u>objects</u> take precedence over ID definitions, which take precedence
        over custom definitions.</b></li>
        <li>Bypass mode defines the whole msg as the request payload</li>
        <li>Internally, ALL request payloads are formated as newline terminated JSON strings for transport then recovered 
            from responses as JavaScript objects.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>msg.payload</code> is the successful broker response.</li>
        <li><code>msg.error</code> object may be defined if some error occurs in the response.</li>
        <li>Other properties from the original <code>msg.payload</code> will NOT normally be preserved.</li>
    </ul>
